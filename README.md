It's using the [Noroff API V2](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2/) for authentication and auction data. It's made with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for a modern and simplistic design style.

- A registered user may create a `Listing` with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
